                Sometimes People dont really see what goes on in the world and thats ok
             until at that point where enough is enough and noone can see whats ahead without a 
             war inside people , doesnt mean if its a protest or a empty space, noone wants to feel unwanted and most importantly
             to feel under someones feet, being controled , being checked upon. 
             Thinking stuff wont change unless someone doesnt gets up for anothe , humanity is wellknown for being able to think and decide with logic
             and not only feeling
