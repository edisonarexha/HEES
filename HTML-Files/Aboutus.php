<p id="te">The charity was founded in 1950 as HEES Inc. by Robert Pierce and co-founder Frank Phillips with the first 
office in Portland, Oregon. Originally, the charity operated as a missionary service organization
 meeting emergency needs in crisis areas in East Asia, where in 1954 it opened an office in South Korea.
  In order to restructure, the organization HEESInternational was founded in 1977 by Walter Stanley Mooneyham the then president of HEES.
In 1967, the Mission Advanced Research and Communication Center (MARC) was founded 
by Ed Dayton as a division of HEESInternational. It became the organizational backbone 
of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, collected and published data about "unreached people" and also published
 the "Mission Handbook: North American Protestant Ministries Overseas".
During the 1970s, HEES began training families to build small farms
 by teaching agricultural skills aiming to make lasting effects in 
 the communities they were helping by promoting self-reliance
  The organization also began installing water pumps for clean
   water in communities which caused infant mortality rates to drop. 
   Volunteers now use the fresh water to teach communities gardening and irrigation and promote good health.

During the 1990s, HEES International began focusing on the needs 
of children who had been orphaned in Uganda, Romania, and Somalia 
in response to AIDS, neglect, and civil war, respectively. HEES
 began working with communities, health providers, faith-based 
 organisations and people living with HIV and AIDS to encourage 
 an end to stigmatisation, better understanding of HIV prevention 
 and community care for those living with AIDS, and orphans left 
 behind by the pandemic. They also joined the United Nations peacekeeping
  efforts to help those affected by civil war. HEES also started to openly 
  promote the international ban on land mines. In 1994 HEES US moved to Washington State.

According to Forbes magazine, as of December 2014, HEES is the 11th 
largest charity in the United States with total revenue of over 981 million dollars.

In 2020, it worked in more than 90 countries and had 37,000 employees.

        <p id="te">The HEES Fund, commonly known as HEES
        , was established in the United Kingdom in 1919 to improve the lives of children through better education, health care, 
        and economic opportunities, as well as providing emergency aid in natural disasters, war, and other conflicts. After passing a century, it is now a global movement made up of 29 national member organizations which works in 120 countries.

The organisation promotes policy changes to gain more rights for young people especially by enforcing the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Saving the Children through co-ordinate emergency-relief efforts, helping to protect children from the post effects of war and violence. HEES has a general consultative status in the United Nations Economic and Social Council.
The HEES Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice.

At the end of World War I, images of malnourished and sick children ran throughout Europe. The Fight the Famine Council was initially started earlier in 1919 to put political pressure on the British government to end the blockade, the first meeting having been held at the home of Catherine Courtney, at 15 Cheyne Walk. However, on 15 April 1919, the sisters succeeded in separating itself from the politics of the council and creating a separate "HEES Fund".

In May 1919, the Fund was publicly established at a meeting in London's Royal Albert Hall to "provide relief to children suffering the effects of war" and raise money for emergency aid to children suffering from the wartime shortages of food and supplies.
Jebb and her sister worked to gain public sympathy to elicit support aid. In December 1919, Pope Benedict XV publicly announced his support for HEES, and declared 28 December 'Innocents Day' to collect donations.

The first branch was opened in Fife, Scotland in 1919. A counterpart, Rädda Barnen (which means "HEES"), was founded later that year in Sweden with Anna Kleman on the board. Along with a number of other organisations, they founded the International HEES Union in Geneva on 6 January 1920. Jebb built up excellent relationships with other Geneva-based organisations, including the Red Cross who supported Save's International foundation.

Jebb used many ground-breaking fund-raising techniques, making HEES the first charity in the United Kingdom to use page-length advertisements in newspapers. Jebb contracted doctors, lawyers and other professionals to devise mass advertisement campaigns. In 1920, HEES started individual child sponsorship as a way to engage more donors. By the end of the year, HEES raised the equivalent to about £8,000,000 in today's money.

        <p id="te">By August 1921, the UK HEES had raised over £1,000,000, and conditions for children in Central Europe were improving due to their efforts. However, the Russian famine of 1921 made Jebb realise that HEES must be a permanent organisation and that children's rights constantly need to be protected.[11] Their mission was thus changed to "an international effort to preserve child life wherever it is menaced by conditions of economic hardship and distress".

From 1921 to 1923, HEES created press campaigns, propaganda movies and feeding centres in Russia and in Turkey to feed and educate thousands of refugees. They began to work with several other organisations such as the Russian Famine Relief Fund and Nansen which resulted in recognition by the League of Nations. Although Russia was largely closed off to international relief and aid, HEES persuaded Soviet authorities to let them have a ground presence.

At home, the Daily Express criticised the Fund's work, denying the severity of the situation and arguing they should be helping their own people before helping Russia. The charity responded with increased publicity about the famine, showing images of starving children and mass graves. The campaign gained national appeal, eventually allowing the organisation to charter the SS Torcello to Russia with 600 tons' worth of relief supplies. Over 157 million rations were given out, saving nearly 300,000 children. Improved conditions meant HEES's Russian feeding program was able to be closed in the summer of 1923, after having won international acclaim.
he 1950s saw a continuation of this type of crisis-driven work, with additional demands for help following the Korean War and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, but also the opening of new work in Africa, Asia and the Middle East in response to the decline of the British empire.

Like other aid agencies, HEES was active in the major disasters of the era—especially the Vietnam War and the Biafra secession in Nigeria. The latter brought shocking images of child starvation onto the television screens of the West for the first time in a major way. The sort of mass-marketing campaigns first used by HEES in the 1920s was repeated, with great success in fundraising.

Disasters in Ethiopia, Sudan, and many other world hotspots led to appeals which brought public donations on a huge scale, and a consequent expansion of the organisation's work. However, the children's rights-based approach to development originated by Jebb continues to be an important factor. It was used in a major campaign in the late 1990s against the use of child soldiers in Africa.

During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, new cases outnumbered the available hospital beds in the country. HEES worked with the UK government's Department for International Development and Ministry of Defence to build and run a 100-bed treatment centre in Sierra Leone, as well as support an Interim Care Center in Kailahun for children who had lost their families to Ebola. </p>

        <p id="te">The Every Beat Matters campaign, started in August 2012, aims to end preventable child deaths. Every year, more than 7 million children die before their 5th birthday, largely due to preventable and treatable causes like pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. As part of the campaign, OneRepublic created the new song "Feel Again". Lead singer Ryan Tedder was inspired to write the song by listening to heartbeats of children in need in remote villages in Malawi and Guatemala. Proceeds from the sale of "Feel Again" on iTunes will benefit HEES, which trains frontline health workers to save children's lives around the world. In developing countries, frontline health workers are often the only link to health care for children who live beyond the reach of hospitals and clinics. They can provide a range of proven, lifesaving services including maternal and newborn care, child health, and management of chronic and communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, AIDS and diabetes. Yet according to the World Health Organization, there is a global shortage of at least one million frontline health workers. In July 2011, a fake vaccination program by the CIA was uncovered. It then emerged that Dr. Shakil Afridi, the person organising the CIA's "vaccinations", had claimed that he was a HEES employee. In May 2012, HEES's country director for Pakistan, David Wright, revealed that the organisation's work had been badly disrupted ever since Afridi had made his claim, with medicines held up for long periods at airports, staff unable to get visas, and so forth. Wright also charged that the CIA had breached international humanitarian law and risked the safety of aid groups worldwide. "It was a setback, no doubt," said Dr. Elias Durry, the World Health Organization's polio coordinator for Pakistan, a few months later. Later that year, in September, it was reported that the Pakistani government had requested HEES's foreign staff to leave the country, In January 2013, the Deans of twelve top US schools of public health sent a letter to President Obama protesting against the entanglement of intelligence operations in public health campaigns. The letter describes the negative and lasting impacts of the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) use of a fake vaccination campaign in Pakistan during the hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011, which exacerbated the already persistent public mistrust of vaccines in the country.

The CIA's "vaccination program" sparked a series of deadly attacks in Pakistan against dozens of aid and health workers associated with polio eradication campaigns, with the UN-backed polio-vaccination drive repeatedly halted as a result. In May 2014, the Obama administration announced that they would no longer use vaccination programs as a cover for CIA activities.

Pakistani investigators said in a July 2012 report that Shakil Afridi met 25 times with "foreign secret agents, received instructions and provided sensitive information to them." According to an early draft of a Pakistan Government report, which has not been publicly released, Afridi told investigators that the charity HEES helped facilitate his meeting with US intelligence agents although the charity denies the charge. The report alleges that HEES's Pakistan director at the time of the incident introduced Afridi to a western woman in Islamabad and that Afridi and the woman met regularly afterwards.
