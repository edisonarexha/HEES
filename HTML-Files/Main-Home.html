            <p>
               H.E.E.S is an organization that does help to people , since we know that most of the world
               dont have much to feed themself and go to school so we decided to organize
               this organization to help the poor to help the weak to help us
               .The world we see now is a fruit of our work before, we did bad to our nature
               now nature is doing bad to us. We need to work on  it to protect us , to protect our 
               future. The more we are into it the more we know about the humanity.The more we think and work
               the more we help and make people happy , people need food, water
               health incurence and happiness sometimes we think we might have been into that position
               and we would want to be helped so help us to help u every human ever should help each other
               based to how much we should care about each other .Beautiful stories we will see later on these pages
               The more we work about us the more we win!

            <h1> Human Rights: Ethics and Law  </h1>
            <p>
                What kind of an assertion does a declaration of human rights make? I
                would submit that proclamations of human rights are to be seen as articulations of ethical demands. They are, in this respect, comparable with
                pronouncements in utilitarian ethics, even though their respective substantive contents are, obviously, very different. Like other ethical claims
                that demand acceptance, there is an implicit presumption in making
                pronouncements on human rights that the underlying ethical claims will
                survive open and informed scrutiny. Indeed, the invoking of such aninteractive process of critical scrutiny, open to information (including
                that about other societies) as well as to arguments coming from far as
                well as near, is a central feature of the theory of human rights proposed
                here. It differs both (i) from trying to justify the ethics of human rights
                in terms of shared—and already established—universal values (the
                uncomplicated “non-partisan” view), and (ii) from abdicating any claim
                of adherence to universal values (and in this sense, eschewing any claim
                to being “non-partisan”) in favor of a particular political conception that
                is suitable to the contemporary world.5
                These issues, which relate to the foundational discipline of ethical critique, will be examined later, in Section IX, in response to question (6).
                But the point to note for the moment, in answer to the first question, is
                that pronouncements of human rights are quintessentially ethical articulations, and they are not, in particular, putative legal claims, despite
                considerable confusion on this point, generated not least by Jeremy
                Bentham, the obsessive slayer of what he took to be legal pretensions. (I
                shall return later in this section to the nature of the misapprehension
                involved.)
                A pronouncement of human rights includes an assertion of the
                importance of the corresponding freedoms—the freedoms that are identified and privileged in the formulation of the rights in question—and is
                indeed motivated by that importance. For example, the human right of
                not being tortured springs from the importance of freedom from torture
                for all. But it includes, furthermore, an affirmation of the need for others
                to consider what they can reasonably do to secure the freedom from
                torture for any person. For a would-be torturer, the demand is obviously
                quite straightforward, to wit, to refrain and desist. The demand takes the
                clear form of what Immanuel Kant called a perfect obligation.6 However,
                for others too (that is, those other than the would-be torturers) there are
                responsibilities, even though they are less specific and come in the
                general form of “imperfect obligations” (to invoke another Kantianconcept).7 The perfectly specified demand not to torture anyone is supplemented by the more general, and less exactly specified, requirement
                to consider the ways and means through which torture can be prevented
                and then to decide what one should, thus, reasonably do. The relations
                between human rights, freedoms, and obligations will be further investigated in Sections IV through VI
