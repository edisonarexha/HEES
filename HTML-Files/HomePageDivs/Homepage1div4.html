                Few concepts are as frequently invoked in contemporary political discussions as human rights. There is something deeply attractive in the
idea that every person anywhere in the world, irrespective of citizenship
or territorial legislation, has some basic rights, which others should
respect. The moral appeal of human rights has been used for a variety of
purposes, from resisting torture and arbitrary incarceration to demanding the end of hunger and of medical neglect.1
At the same time, the central idea of human rights as something that
people have, and have even without any specific legislation, is seen by
many as foundationally dubious and lacking in cogency. A recurrent
question is, Where do these rights come from? It is not usually disputed
that the invoking of human rights can be politically powerful. Rather,
the worries relate to what is taken to be the “softness” (some would
say “mushiness”) of the conceptual grounding of human rights. Many
philosophers and legal theorists see the rhetoric of human rights as justloose talk—perhaps kindly and well meaning forms of locution—but
loose talk nevertheless.
The contrast between the widespread use of the idea of human rights
and the intellectual skepticism about its conceptual soundness is not
new. The U.S. Declaration of Independence, in 1776, took it to be “selfevident” that everyone is “endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights,” and thirteen years later, the French declaration of “the rights
of man” asserted that “men are born and remain free and equal in rights.”
But it did not take Jeremy Bentham long, in his Anarchical Fallacies
written during 1791 and 1792 (aimed against the French “rights of man”),
to propose the total dismissal of all such claims. Bentham insisted that
“natural rights is simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptible rights (an
American phrase), rhetorical nonsense, nonsense upon stilts.”2 That suspicion remains very alive today, and despite persistent use of the idea
of human rights in practical affairs, there are many who see the idea of
human rights as no more than “bawling upon paper,” to use another of
Bentham’s barbed portrayals of natural right claims.
The dismissal of human rights is often comprehensive and is aimed
against any belief in the existence of rights that people can have unconditionally, simply by virtue of their humanity (rather than having them
contingently, on the basis of specific qualifications, such as citizenship
or legal entitlements). Some critics, however, propose a discriminating
rejection: they accept the general idea of human rights but exclude, from
the acceptable list, specific classes of proposed rights, in particular the
so-called economic and social rights, or welfare rights. These rights,
which are sometimes referred to as second generation rights, such as a
common entitlement to subsistence or to medical care, have mostly
been added relatively recently to earlier enunciations of human rights,
thereby vastly expanding the claimed domain of human rights

            <p>
                What kind of an assertion does a declaration of human rights make? I
                would submit that proclamations of human rights are to be seen as articulations of ethical demands. They are, in this respect, comparable with
                pronouncements in utilitarian ethics, even though their respective substantive contents are, obviously, very different. Like other ethical claims
                that demand acceptance, there is an implicit presumption in making
                pronouncements on human rights that the underlying ethical claims will
                survive open and informed scrutiny. Indeed, the invoking of such aninteractive process of critical scrutiny, open to information (including
                that about other societies) as well as to arguments coming from far as
                well as near, is a central feature of the theory of human rights proposed
                here. It differs both (i) from trying to justify the ethics of human rights
                in terms of shared—and already established—universal values (the
                uncomplicated “non-partisan” view), and (ii) from abdicating any claim
                of adherence to universal values (and in this sense, eschewing any claim
                to being “non-partisan”) in favor of a particular political conception that
                is suitable to the contemporary world.5
                These issues, which relate to the foundational discipline of ethical critique, will be examined later, in Section IX, in response to question (6).
                But the point to note for the moment, in answer to the first question, is
                that pronouncements of human rights are quintessentially ethical articulations, and they are not, in particular, putative legal claims, despite
                considerable confusion on this point, generated not least by Jeremy
                Bentham, the obsessive slayer of what he took to be legal pretensions. (I
                shall return later in this section to the nature of the misapprehension
                involved.)
                A pronouncement of human rights includes an assertion of the
                importance of the corresponding freedoms—the freedoms that are identified and privileged in the formulation of the rights in question—and is
                indeed motivated by that importance. For example, the human right of
                not being tortured springs from the importance of freedom from torture
                for all. But it includes, furthermore, an affirmation of the need for others
                to consider what they can reasonably do to secure the freedom from
                torture for any person. For a would-be torturer, the demand is obviously
                quite straightforward, to wit, to refrain and desist. The demand takes the
                clear form of what Immanuel Kant called a perfect obligation.6 However,
                for others too (that is, those other than the would-be torturers) there are
                responsibilities, even though they are less specific and come in the
                general form of “imperfect obligations” (to invoke another Kantianconcept).7 The perfectly specified demand not to torture anyone is supplemented by the more general, and less exactly specified, requirement
                to consider the ways and means through which torture can be prevented
                and then to decide what one should, thus, reasonably do. The relations
                between human rights, freedoms, and obligations will be further investigated in Sections IV through VI
