                Smith’s observations have been echoed by social scientists and researchers on
                task design again and again (e.g., Walker and Guest, 1952; Marx, 1977: chapter
                15). The most recent influential approach to task design (Hackman and
                Oldham, 1975, 1976) emphasized the importance of a set of five task characteristics (variety, autonomy, task identity, feedback, and significance) if people
                were to be motivated at work. More recent research (e.g., Morgeson and
                Humphrey, 2006) has added a relational aspect to these characteristics, given
                that people do not work in isolation from each other.
                It might be thought, therefore, that the argument was over and that organizational scholarship completely understood the importance of designing jobs to
                include a variety of tasks, decision-making autonomy, feedback on performance, and the other important elements highlighted over the centuries. But
                there seems to be an eternal opposition between such enlightened views and
                a strain of organizational scholarship that focuses on organizational control over
                every aspect of the employee’s life. This control perspective is captured in
                March and Simon’s 1958 classic entitled Organizations in which employees are
                depicted as programmable computing machines: programs can either be ‘‘built
                into machines or acquired by humans’’ (p. 158). The tasks of leadership in this
                dystopian world include having to ‘‘neutralize or eliminate the dysfunctional
                consequences of subgroup organization’’ and ‘‘forcing lower-echelon leaders to
                conform to the demands of the hierarchy’’ (p. 22). This control perspective is a
                recurring presence in organizational scholarship (Perrow, 1973) irrespective of
                the losses to productivity and innovation that derive from the overemphasis on
                metrics, compliance, and regimen (see the case study of factory organization in
                Bernstein, 2012). In this context, Cable’s book offers a new take on the perennial struggle for humans to fulfill their potential through work.

                Cable’s book articulates the connection between job design and the neuropsychology of the individual employee. The emphasis throughout the book is
                on what Cable describes as the seeking system, a cognitive process that
                releases dopamine when curiosity is acted on and that leads to exploration,
                self-expression, and focused experimentation. These behaviors, in a reinforcing
                loop, further activate the seeking system. What is striking in his book, therefore, is the link between job design and the individual’s biology. This is something new—the claim, backed up by compelling evidence, that organizations of
                the kind depicted in and recommended by March and Simon (1958) are
                designed to suppress our natural impulses, to turn off employee engagement,
                and to thereby lose the advantages of innovation and motivation that can be
                released if the seeking system is incorporated into organizational life.
                The book is divided into four parts, each of which has two or three chapters. The first part outlines the neuroscience of the seeking system, setting
                up the ideas for how the organization should be designed if human potential
                is to be optimized. Cable locates exploration, a prominent topic in the strategy literature, at the individual level as an inherent human tendency too often
                repressed by fear of authority, adherence to metrics, and ignorance of
                human potential. The second part of the book builds on the work by Cable
                and others on how enabling self-expression at work allows individuals to
                flourish within a framework of understood goals and values. Part 3 explores
                the importance of playfulness at work and the role of humble leaders in
                enabling learning to flow upward from employees to leaders. And the fourth
                part relates all of the foregoing to the ways in which people find purpose in
                their jobs—however apparently menial these jobs might be. The key is in the
                self-narratives that connect work with the recipients of the work. Thus the
                hospital cleaner is mindful of the patients whose lives are saved, and the university fundraising team is in touch with the students whose scholarships
                are life-changingThroughout the book, Cable illustrates his points with vivid stories of people
                and companies from his personal engagements. If I have one quibble it is with
                the somewhat uncritical acceptance of organizations as in the business of saving souls. The book begins with some graffiti that Cable noticed in London: ‘‘I
                wonder what my soul does all day when I’m at work.’’ At the very end of the
                book, Cable suggests that organizational leaders have duties that are ‘‘similar
                to religious figures’’ (p. 173). Elsewhere, he champions the idea of leader
                authenticity. Certain leaders are more authentic than others, we are told, and
                therefore are able to engage their employees’ best selves, provide them with
                purpose, fire up employees’ seeking systems. Alas for those leaders who
                suffer from inauthenticity. They are depicted as fakes who seek to manipulate
                employees’ emotions. But this whole idea of authenticity has been criticized by
                one of the very people whose research the book relies on (Grant, 2016). The
                idea that there is some kind of true self does not bear scrutiny (Wetzel, 2015).
                What is true is that some people—like skilled actors—are able to portray themselves in ways that appear convincing and compelling (Snyder, 1987), whereas
                other people struggle to articulate thoughts and ideas that are deeply and sincerely held. Who is most authentic—the actor on the stage who brings tears to
                the eyes in a depiction of a grieving parent, or an actual grieving parent who
                2 Administrative Science Quarterly (2018)
                appears wooden and cold because he or she cannot muster the words to
                express inconsolable emotions?Thus I have reservations about the idea that authentic leaders who humble
                themselves will rescue our souls and take on the mantle of religious leaders in
                the new Jerusalem of organizational behavior. This aside, the book is a moving
                and compelling call to arms that is built on solid research findings and provides
                a series of relevant recommendations for all of us involved with teaching,
                administration, and research
