                Academic self-concept is defined as an individual’s perception of their competence in a
                specific domain (Marsh & Martin, 2011). The construct is typically operationalized by asking
                students how good they think they are in a specific domain such as Mathematics or Biology
                (Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). There are countless studies, including metaanalyses, reporting moderate to high positive correlations (.30 ≤ r ≤ .60) between academic
                self-concept and school achievement (e.g., Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003; Helmke & van
                Aken, 1995; Huang, 2011; Marsh et al., 2005; Möller et al., 2009; Valentine et al., 2004).
                There is some evidence that one’s academic self-concept develops over time and therefore
                that the correlation with school achievement increases when students get older (e.g., Authors,
                2005). The correlation between academic self-concept and school achievement is typically
                higher when both are operationalized as domain-specific rather than domain-general (e.g.,
                Marsh & Craven, 2006; Authors, 2009) and in cross-sectional studies compared to
                longitudinal studies (e.g., Guay, Marsh, & Boivin, 2003; Marsh & Yeung, 1997; Valentine et
                al., 2004). Valentine (2001) showed that the relation between academic self-concept and
                school achievement became weaker when the time interval between the measurement
                occasions increased. Furthermore, multiple research groups have found that academic self

                concept predicts school achievement over and above intelligence and that academic selfconcept is a better predictor of school grades than other motivational constructs such as task
values (e.g., Chamorro-Premuzic, Harlaar, Greven, & Plomin, 2010; Helmke, 1992; Authors,
2015; Steinmayr & Meißner, 2013; Authors, 2009; Zaunbauer, Retelsdorf, & Möller, 2009).
On the basis of these findings, we expected motivation to be a better predictor of school
achievement when expectancies such as academic self-concept are used compared to other
motivational constructs such as values. Also, the correlation between motivation and school
achievement should be higher when both are operationalized domain-specifically and crosssectional compared to longitudinal and when samples from higher grades are investigated
Self-efficacy is defined as individual expectancies about future performance and is
typically measured as one’s conviction about how well one will be able to solve a certain task
in the future (Bandura, 1997). Thus, self-efficacy is more closely related to specific tasks than
academic self-concept. Findings from different studies have revealed moderate to high
positive correlations between self-efficacy and school achievement (e.g., Bong & Clark,
1999; Schunk & Schwartz, 1993; Zimmermann, 2000). In their meta-analysis, Robbins and
colleagues (2004) found an average correlation between self-efficacy and grade point average
(GPA) of r = .38. Moreover, they reported that math-specific self-efficacy predicts math
achievement over and above intelligence (e.g., Authors, 2015; Stevens et al., 2004, 2006).
Those studies also found self-efficacy to be a more powerful predictor of standardized test
achievement over and above intelligence than other motivational constructs such as task
values. Based on these results, we expect the relation between motivation and school
achievement to be higher when expectancies, such as self-efficacy and academic self-concept,
are assessed rather than other motivational constructs such as values.The value attributed to a certain task comprises different components, namely intrinsic
value (enjoyment of the task, interest), importance value (importance of doing well on a
certain task), utility value (utility of a certain task for one’s future) and a cost component
(Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000). Only the first three value components are
normally assessed, and they are typically assessed domain-specifically. Positive associations
between values and school achievement have repeatedly been reported. The results are
consistent in that the relationship between values and school achievement (both grades and
standardized test achievement) is typically weak to moderate (e.g., Ozel, Caglak & Erdogan,
2013; Trautwein et al., 2012). Authors (2010) found that the correlations with school grades
were higher when values were assessed domain-specifically than domain-generally. A few
studies showed that values predict school grades (Authors, 2009) as well as standardized test
achievement in math and English over and above intelligence (Trautwein et al., 2012). On the
basis of these results and as reported above in the section about academic self-concept, we
expect the correlation between motivation and school achievement to be higher when both are
operationalized domain-specifically, and to be lower for values as motivational constructs
compared to expectancies
